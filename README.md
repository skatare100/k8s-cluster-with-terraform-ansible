#  Kubernetes Cluster Deployment with Terraform & Ansible  

This project demonstrates how to automate the provisioning of a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using **Terraform** for infrastructure as code (IaC) and **Ansible** for configuration management. The setup includes an AWS VPC, an EKS cluster, and EC2 instances as worker nodes.

##  Tech Stack  
- **Terraform**  – Automates AWS infrastructure provisioning  
- **Ansible**  – Configures and manages Kubernetes nodes  
- **Kubernetes (EKS)**  – Orchestrates containerized applications  
- **AWS**  – Cloud provider for deployment  
- **Jenkins & Groovy**  – Automates deployment  

##  Features  
✅ Fully automated Kubernetes cluster setup  
✅ Uses Terraform modules for better maintainability  
✅ Ansible for configuration management  
✅ Scalable & production-ready infrastructure  

##  How to Use  
1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/k8s-cluster-with-terraform-ansible.git
